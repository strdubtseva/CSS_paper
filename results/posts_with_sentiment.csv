12q2b0e,Chatgpt Helped me pass an exam with 94% despite never attending or watching a class.,"Hello, This is just my review and innovation on utilizing Ai to assist with education

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

I have never used AI in this essay or his other essays; there's the revision history to prove it but really, no other way to prove myself otherwise as far as I can tell. Since then, he's given me zeros in other assignments due to the accusation of AI as I think he no longer trusts my writing. I use Grammarly, spell-checkers, and thesauruses online to try to sound more sophisticated than I really am. Is there no way to prove myself otherwise besides going to his superiors?

14afmpj,What to do AFTER you are falsely accused of using AI at college/university,"I'm a university advisor and have undergraduate students who need guidance on what to do AFTER they have been falsely accused of using AI on assignments. *(Edit) In the accusation email that students receive, this text is included, meaning there is no conversation or defense possible: ""Turnitin detected the use of AI in your paper. While I can't see which AI tool you used, the AI detection score is final.""*

I have no idea what I'm doing, just trying to advocate for my students. My university has no guidelines, policies, or adjudication for academic misconduct accusations for AI detection.

Here is what I have so far - please add your ideas!

1. Recover your document version history (this differs between Google and MS365). This can show your revisions, deletions, and additions over time.
2. Recover your browser history - this is problematic in so many ways. Still, I'm hoping that students can prove they were doing keyword searches, spending time on multiple websites, excluding results that don't quite fit the assignment, etc.
3. Run the accusing faculty member's own research papers/thesis through an AI detector, and if the results are similar to your accusation, use that as proof it is faulty.
4. Run your own pre-AI (2020, 2021) writing assignments through the AI detector, and if the results are similar to your accusation, use that as proof it is faulty.
5. Specifically request in an email while cc-ing other college officials (your advisor, the department head, another professor you trust, etc.): Please provide a ***preponderance of evidence that you researched*** ***without the use of AI which specific parts of my assignment were plagiarized or that used AI.*** In other words, faculty can't say: don't use AI; my AI said you used AI; therefore, you get a zero.
6. Research your student misconduct policies; there will almost always be an opportunity for some sort of appeal. Forward your email chain with your faculty to the dean of students, department head, university president, dean of student conduct, etc.
7. Meet on Zoom and record the entire thing, never accept phone calls or other ways they can avoid accountability
8. NEVER EVER NEVER meet with your faculty member in person without recording the interaction. Audio, video, etc. If they won't meet with you without being recorded, request an advocate be present at your meeting - an academic advisor, another faculty member, another student, the admin assistant, etc.
9. Ask what software has been used and what guarantees the developer gives about its accuracy and false positive rates.

ETA: I'm based in the US and welcome input on processes in other countries.

Edit #2: If your college allows it, the first step after an accusation is to calmly and nicely refute the accusation in an email, and request a meeting (make sure someone else is also present). Before the meeting, prepare your evidence as above so that you can show your work.

Edit #3: 2/22/24 Looks like student Marley Stevens at University of North Georgia is getting some local attention for something similar: Using Grammarly on an assignment.

1d8bumn,Can I sue my university for wrongly accusing me of using AI? ,"I wrote in here about a week ago explaining that I had a Conduct Hearing with my university to discuss the allegations levied against me that I had used AI on two Discussion Board posts. That hearing was completed about two hours ago, and boy, they really love TurnItIn’s AI software. They say it is wildly accurate and very rarely makes any mistakes, and the decision has yet to be made by the Dean. He was siding with me throughout almost the entire hearing, so I feel good about his energy. I provided numerous different AI scores from different outlets that said my content was authentic. I had scores range from 0%-21-% “AI Generated”, while TurnItIn’s said my work was 96% AI. I also included numerous articles calling AI detectors into question and other major university statements on why they have disabled TurnItIn’s AI detector. I was also told that it is not mandated at my university for professors to use TurnItIn’s AI detector. This lone professor, apparently, is the only one who uses it. I assure you, I have not used it. I have no reason to come in here and lie. So, my question is, IF the Dean makes the decision to sign off on this and fail me in the course, can I pursue any legal action? If so, how good of a chance do you think I would have of winning, or if it would even be worth it? I need less than 23 hours to graduate and am a 4.0 GPA student, just for context.  Thanks a bunch.

186esmm,I chose the wrong time to finish college.,"My sister is in high school and she — like many high schoolers — uses ChatGPT to write her stuff, scans the text with an ai-checker, and modifies it to bring the AI detection percentage down. In this case she was trying to get her percentage of 49 down. 

I thought it was silly, especially since what she was writing was so short (compared to the stuff we write in college… ahh I miss how easy high school was) that it was pointless to use AI to write it. So I told her to give me her laptop and I would rewrite what she wrote with my own fingers and brain instead of an AI. 

So I did.

15wvysk,"My professor falsely accused me on cheating, failed me for the class, and reported me to the college board for academic dishonesty. Advice?","I am in my final quarter at a community college, and I am admitted to a large university in fall quarter this year and was accepted to my major. My acceptance to the program was contingent upon the completion of one final course, so I was taking the course this summer and was to send my final transcript over once final grades had been posted. Everything was going well, I had a 96% in the class, and submitted my final assignment this Tuesday. 

I check my email today and see that my professor gave me a 0 on the final project, which brought my grade down to a failing grade as it accounted for 40% of our total grade. The only feedback she gave was ""You are not allowed to use outside resources and AI generated responses"". I absolutely DID NOT use AI or use any outside resources. The assignment was computational and I showed my work. The only resources I used were notes that I had taken throughout the quarter, most of which were directly paraphrased from her lectures. She gave no rubric for the final project and I don't even understand how she could have extrapolated me using ChatGPT for a math project? 

I am absolutely shocked and I feel so upset. She reported it to the college board which means this will be on my record and I am extremely afraid that my acceptance to the university will be rescinded/revoked. I have worked so, so hard for the past 3 years and I have never once been accused of cheating or anything of the sort. Has anyone every experienced something like this before? What do I do? 

Tl;dr: My professor falsely accused me of cheating/using chatgpt on a computation project and reported me to the college board for academic dishonesty. I am supposed to be transferring to a 4 yr university this fall and I am so scared I will get kicked out. WTF do I do??!

UPDATE: I emailed her and we are speaking tomorrow. I am scared because i know she’s going to ask to see the version history, but the issue is that I work on google docs and convert to word doc to submit because she only accepts word files. The word doc doesn’t have an edit history because of this, and the file is completely gone from google docs and I cannot recover it seemingly. Fuuuuuu*k me! Thanks for all the support and advice guys!

UPDATE 2: Alright so i met with my professor. I don’t know why I was anticipating her to be more understanding of this whole situation, but she was extremely accusatory and confrontational seeming that she was 100% certain that I had cheated. Her explanation was that I used a method to solve an equation that she allegedly never showed us, therefore I must have looked it up or had a bot complete the problem for me. I proceeded to tell her that in one of her lectures that she shared (pre recorded from seven years ago, she hasn’t updated anything since), she mentioned this method as one of three acceptable methods of solving the problem. So for the whole quarter, i had been using this method. I even found the video clip of her referencing this method. She back tracked and said that she never provided the specific template for this method, so i must have had to look it up. I showed her that I found the template from the assigned textbook. Then, she proceeded to ask me other impromptu exam questions for me to solve on the spot which I could not do because this is an intro level class and I am not yet equipped to solve these philosophical math questions on a whim. While i tried to answer these questions, she made mocking/confused faces at me.

Once she had prodded me about everything, I simply asked her if she was going to proceed with reporting this to the school board. She said she would not do this, but there were numerous other students that made the same mistake (?) as me that she will be reporting. She did not fix the grade, but will all my completed work, i rounded out to a C and i am okay with that as long as I do not have academic dishonesty on my record. Once the conversation was over, i tried to politely thank her for her time and understanding and she responded “yep, bye” and signed off the meeting. 

All in all, very strange experience that i was so not expecting. So glad it is taken care of. Thanks to everyone for your advice and kindness!

10waibw,How to avoid being accused of using AI in College/University.,"The advent of ChatGPT has taken the academic landscape by storm. While professors and TAs have been using Turnitin and Safeassign to identify plagiarism, confusion still reigns on the best way to detect AI-generated writeups. From my experience, the tools use unreliable factors in their identification algorithms. As such, several students who have worked on their papers are falsely flagged by these tools. As they develop, these tools will certainly improve these factors to the extent that they will detect all AI-generated texts.

Until then, here are some tips to avoid getting penalized if your ESSAY is flagged:

1. Do real research, including a list of all peer-reviewed journal articles used. Save copies of these journal articles and highlight areas you used for the essay.
2. Master your paper. Even if you have written the paper, ensure you master the concepts and arguments of your paper because this is what it is meant for anyway. I have seen cases in multiple universities where a prof will write an email requesting a one-on-one chat with the student just to ask very specific questions on specific parts of the essay.
3. Involve the Prof. or tutor in the assignment: Ask the professor a few questions about the challenges you are facing with the assignment. This is not meant for anything but evidence that you were actually working and faced some challenges. If allowed, try to send the prof a draft of your work to get some feedback.
4. Search ChatGPT and ask it for an outline for that question: use chatGPT to avoid being like it. The tutor has most likely tried varied keyword entries on the AI and seen possible indicators to raise an alarm. Check and avoid them",740,141,2023-02-07 20:22:03,college,0.7092198581560284,0.7092198581560284,0.7092198581560284,2.127659574468085,0.0,0.7092198581560284,2.127659574468085,2.8368794326241136,0.7092198581560284,0.7092198581560284,1.4184397163120568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7092198581560284,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.056737588652481,0.7092198581560284,0.0,0.0,0.7092198581560284,0.7092198581560284

18h2t8h,People use AI incorrectly.,"I've always been of the camp that AI (chatbots like ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) are technological tools just like a lot of inventions that have shaped and changed education into what it is today. Technology such as search engines, digitized library indexes, word processors, etc.

With technologies that have been around, we know how to harness it to their fullest extent and not abuse it. For example, we know not to go on Google or Wikipedia, search for an essay or topic, copy/paste, and submit it as our own work. AI should be used similarly. One shouldn't go on ChatGPT and ask it, ""write me an essay about XYZ topic,"" copy/paste that, and submit that. Of course that's intellectual dishonesty.

For example, I recently saw a post here about someone lamenting the fact that they were born too early because their sibling just copy/pastes AI-generated essays as their own assignment. At the risk of sounding like Ned Flanders, *you shouldn't be doing that anyways*. And counterpoint—your parents probably felt the same way when Google became popular and plagiarism detectors weren't as prolific. AI will be a part of daily lives, and like with everything else, society will find a way to regulate it even if it can't now. I'd put money on technology finding a way to effectively detect plagiarism. So people should start learning how to use AI as a tool right now instead of depending on it to do work *for* them.

So how do you use AI to your advantage and as a tool to *enhance* your work instead of plagiarizing? Well, these are some things that I do:

* I feed it a paragraph or two that I might not have a full grasp of and ask it to summarize it to me in a way that is easier to digest.
* I ask it ideas. For example, I was writing an essay earlier this week and struggled to remember/find quotes that would be a good starter for my essay. So I asked ChatGPT, ""can you find me some quotes about XYZ?""
* I ask where I can find more information or resources on a certain topic.
* I've quoted ChatGPT in assignments before as jumping off points. I asked its opinion on a certain topic, quoted it, and used that as a jumping off point to my own opinions.
* Draft emails
* The biggest advantage to ChatGPT, at least in my opinion, is its natural language processing abilities and its ability to remember points of the conversation. Unlike Google where you have to know how to search, you can ask ChatGPT all your specific search parameters without having to understand the ""meta"".

These are just a few ways I use AI as tools. Asking AI to ""write me an essay,"" and then copy/pasting is not only lazy, but it is intellectual dishonesty, full-stop. But just like Google, dictionaries, word processors, and other inventions have been used as tool to advance knowledge, AI should be used in the same way.",301,52,2023-12-13 01:36:02,college,5.769230769230769,0.0,0.0,1.9230769230769231,9.615384615384617,0.0,3.8461538461538463,0.0,1.9230769230769231,0.0,3.8461538461538463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9230769230769231,0.0

1925j58,Professor encouraging and requiring use of AI,"For my intro to macroeconomics class at my local community college, the professor is encouraging us to use AI. 

I personally do not use any AI like chatGPT or anything and I have avoided it in fear of it becoming some sort of crutch. I know this is an unpopular opinion and that AI is apart of our lives in many other senses, but I simply do not like using these programs especially in an educational setting. I also don't understand why I should be required to use AI for a macroeconomics class.

Here are some excerpts from the syllabus, I don't want to give too much information because I don't want to get them in trouble but it states:

 ""Also, you MUST have a subscription to BARD our Chat GPT. Your Chat 3.5 subscription is free. BARD is also free. First you will need a free G-mail email. ""

""AI may be used in taking in-class exams... encourage the use of AI to  better understand Test question concepts ""

It's a hybrid class so I'll be attending once a week, but I want to know other people's thoughts. Personally, I'm a bit uncomfortable with these requirements though I know most people would be happy. I can't drop the class because then I'd be a part-time student and that would cause other issues.

1dvrwcr,Sick of all the robots in my online course.,"I have an online polisci course right now and we're required to do two discussion posts per week, and two responses to classmates for each discussion post, so four of those per week. The problem is 3/4 of my classmates are using ChatGPT to write their posts. Some use it raw and some use it with the QuillBot paraphrasing tool. I know because I've reverse engineered their answers very simply using AI detectors. They're not slick.

Why should I be required to respond to robots like we're all real people having a real discussion?

At this point what's the point of discussion posts if the whole convo is just ChatGPT agreeing with itself?

And the unfortunate part is that the few classmates who don't use robots are the less insightful ones who usually don't have much of value to say.

I tried searching for this paper but couldn't find it anywhere so I asked chatGPT for the link. But the link it provided redirected me to page that doesn't exist because no such paper is written!

1dld7vi,I wish ChatGPT had been around when I was in grad school just to troubleshoot my R code,"Just a random reflection.  If ChatGPT had been around when I was in grad school, I would have been SO much more productive.    
  
In my (2016-2021) PhD program, how many hours did I spend troubleshooting my R (or Stata) code, only to find a slightly misplaced comma or some equally absurd, minor, typo-like issue that ChatGPT could have identified in a matter of seconds?  How many weeks, months, maybe YEARS did I spend trying to figure out how to write the code to create a specific kind of variable or assign weights or some other mundane task that ChatGPT could have quickly coached me on?

I used to schedule time to work side by side at coffee shops with fellow grad students whose coding skills were more advanced.  I'd buy them coffee and pastries as a thank you, and ask them questions whenever I hit a wall.  I struggled so much in the first year that I actually tried to get my department to create a resource of some kind to get more support for coding - office hours or a forum, or SOMEthing (spoiler alert: they did not create any such resource).  ChatGPT would have done the trick.

1bjn27b,ChatGPT basically makes our TA work useless especially when professors just don't seem to care about students cheating and expect us to mark all their easily cheat-able little assignments,"I was pretty angry yesterday when I read in my university's student newspaper interviewing undergrad students who had (apparently) used ChatGPT for their assignments. Obviously some students use ChatGPT but one student mentioned (under fake name) confessed to using ChatGPT for his courses in my discipline, courses that I, as a graduate student (first year PhD) TA have to mark. He said ""ChatGPT is essential for writing my philosophy essays,"" like, are you kidding me? Using ChatGPT for writing assignments ultimately only cheats the student of learning how to write properly, so before this I didn't really care...most of the time assignments that are obviously ChatGPT (in the humanities) are pretty bad, superficial, vague etc. so do not warrant a good mark anyways, so the student is already being penalized by a bad grade even if we can't prove it.

 But this makes me so frustrated because I'm currently working my butt off to get through endless marking for this one TA course I've been assigned to this semester, and spending MY time going above and beyond in trying to provide students feedback/comments etc, while this student (who may very well be in this course) is just wasting his TAs effort by submitting work he didn't even do himself, and smugly calling ChatGPT ""an essential resource"" bragging about it in the student paper. If these were multiple choice exams I wouldn't care, but marking essays--as anyone in the humanities know--is so time consuming (reading it, providing annotated feedback, detailed comments, correcting spelling and grammar ect.) Even more infuriating, while I would hope that he would be getting a bad mark if I was marking him--presumably he is not since he's pleased with ChatGPT-so one of my fellow grad students is clearly giving him and his garbage ChatGPT work a free pass, thereby rewarding the behaviour.

 Additionally, the proff for this course is next to useless, does not answer student emails (so they all come to me), does not give us (the TAs) any guidance or support on marking assignments (which is fine but then students complain to me about marks and I have no rubric or anything to justify myself), and worst of all, has SO MANY little endless assignments ( 3 1500 word exegetical essays, 3 1000 word short answer tests, and 5 discussion posts) that have taken up almost all my entire semester in marking (I have 52 students in my cohort). I have courses this year as a first-year PhD, and I've only finished one of my four for this semester...I still have so much of my own research and writing to do for my own essays but that has all gotten shoved to the end of the semester due to this endless marking. On top of this is my leading tutorial every week for this class (which is an hour a week but took me about 12 hours to prepare all of the materials and do the readings), and I also tend to host a weekly office hour because students come to me to ask/complain about their grade or want support (since the proff is never around), and I genuinely want my students to succeed in this course and give philosophy a fair go (since is a 100 level course). I make no extra money for this extra work since I am on a fixed salary, so it really depends on the proff you get...last semester I only had 1 essay and 1 exam to mark the ENTIRE semester for less students (about 30 in my cohort). 

I'm just angry because it seems professors have not clued into the fact that most students may very well be using ChatGPT to do their assignments, especially when all of the assignments are take-home open book tests or these mini essays that just require you to respond to a prompt. Some proffs also just don't care...last year I got assigned to TA a course that was almost as bad since the proff told the class ""nobody would get less than 70%"" in her class, and then got mad at me when I failed students who had clearly not done the work/answered the question and it was probably ChatGPT. Working for shitty proffs is always a risk as a TA I know that, but essentially all our (underpaid) effort is made to feel even more worthless with ChatGPT now, especially if proffs won't investigate these claims or make assignments more cheat-proof, and especially when proffs cram the course full of little assignments that take endless work to mark and easy to cheat with ChatGPT. 

Ugh. Sorry just had to take a break from marking my 52 essays for this week to rant.

The last couple of words needs tweaking but it's much better. I can continue to improve my writing but I don't see it being better than what ChatGPT does. The other approach is to try and ""emulate"" how ChatGPT phrases sentences but it requires a lot of care not to simply ""copy-paste"" the better phrases into the stuff that I'm writing. 

 

>The final few words still require some refinement, but it's much improved. I can continue to enhance my writing skills, however, I don't believe it will surpass ChatGPT's writing ability.

1379s56,Got bamboozled with a plagiarism case,"I think you'll be entertained with this one. 

Earlier this semester, I asked my students to do a quick mathematical demo in one of the papers they had to submit.

For those who are comfortable with math, it was a two liner thing using commutativity. Come this student who submits a full page with a whole ass mathematical proof using vectors, canonical form, declaring 5 new variables alongside a figure to base his proof on.

Real fancy shit miles above the expected class's level.

There's no way he did that by himself,but I don't find anything online. Would this be my first ChatGPT case? 

There was also some inconsistencies in the proof that were really basic compared to the whole proof. 100% plagiarism but no other proof than my own judgement. I show the work to two other colleagues, who are also baffled by the proof. One even said: I've taught a higher level course on this subject and would never have come up with this.

I call the student to my office. I had highlighted all inconsistencies, wanting to play dumb, asking him to explain what he meant here and there, provoking a direct confession of guilt.

Student arrives, sees his work on my desk and straight up says:

Yeah...I had a gut feeling you wanted to meet me because of that. 

In my head I'm like: well, didn't have to press too hard to have a confession...

BUT

The student is able to explain the whole thing, above and beyond. I ask him questions and he answers straight and clear. Never seen a student so well versed mathematically at his level.

At this point I tell him I suspected plagiarism because of how unusual this quality of work was. He then tells me his father's name and to Google it because otherwise I wouldn't believe the rest of the story. His father has two PhD in math, the same type of math the student used. Indeed, he look just like his father.

He then tells me that since elementary school, his father makes him solve all sorts of riddles and games using vector formalism and that's just the way he handles things all the times. He just *thinks* like that. And yeah, when he saw that commutativity was enough, he laughed. 

I was happy not having to file papers for this case but even more impressed by the father' ability to connect with his son in such a peculiar way.",1764,71,2023-05-04 06:22:52,Professors,11.267605633802818,2.8169014084507045,0.0,0.0,1.4084507042253522,0.0,0.0,1.4084507042253522,2.8169014084507045,1.4084507042253522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4084507042253522,0.0,5.633802816901409,0.0,4.225352112676056,0.0,1.4084507042253522,0.0,0.0,1.4084507042253522

1d7am50,"Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Grades","Been teaching for half a decade. I'm fortunate in that our admin backs up faculty on matters of academic integrity, and don't go for this ""students are our customers"" unmitigated BS. Maybe it's a 🇨🇦 university thing.

So for the first few years I'd of course run across a number of cheaters, plagiarizers, copiers, and more recently ChatGPTers. I would report only the most obvious ones. I hated the paperwork involved, and I also shied away from the emotional expense of confronting students with their crappy cheating behaviour.

Something clicked this semester, though. In week 2 I caught 9 students across four courses cheating. Instead of triaging them to only report the slam dunks, I went full Bruce Lee and went after all of them. First with a blunt email telling them what they did (gotta document it all) and urging them to come clean, and to not prevaricate, or else. Seven of the nine prevaricated, trickle-admitting  (e.g. ""I used ChatGPT for just a little help"") and blaming their behaviour on the stress of a dying relative. The other two were wise enough to just respond with ""Yessir, you caught me, what happens to me now?""

Five to six citations and references and not a single one is a real paper which gave me enough proof to fail them on the project and accuse them of using ChatGPT.

I emailed the student and gave them a chance to revise/resubmit and they took it on the chin. They were worried about their writing and wanted it to sound more ""college-like"" and promised not to do it again. I hope so.

The second was even more egregious than the first. When they copied/pasted into the text box, it still had the formatting box around it that ChatGPT generates. The assignment asks for the student to apply the ABCD concept of a certain assigned reading to a fictional story in another medium. ChatGPT made up what the ABCDs actually WERE, because of course it didn't have any familiarity with the course material.

The student is furious - FURIOUS - that I would accuse them of cheating, and what evidence do I have? Deep sigh.

Recognizing its value, I am sincerely hoping that I might be granted a permission number to secure a spot in this course.

Your support and assistance in providing this permission number would not only be deeply appreciated but also pivotal in shaping my educational path. Enrolling in this course holds the potential to significantly enrich my academic experience and ensure that I remain on the right trajectory toward my graduation goals.

Thank you for considering my request. I am genuinely grateful for your time and attention. I look forward to the possibility of being part of this course and furthering my academic pursuits under your guidance.

1bruzl6,Another Rant about Students ,"By this time in the semester, I’ve usually grown very fond of my students, but this semester is different. I dread teaching and feel disconnected from them. 

It’s everything: the CHATGPT, the tardiness, the phones, the indifference, the rudeness, and the continual and unreasonable demands.

They don’t read the assignments, and they do their work improperly. They just don’t care. 

One class thinks I’m rude because I’m no longer polite when I tell them to stop talking or to get off their phones.

While I realize this critique is gendered  (as I am a young woman), I’m worn out. 

Last week a student said she thought I was rude when I told her (again) to put her phone away, and “that’s why [she] continued to use it.” I said that that was her choice, but I was fuming inside.

I realize I’m not alone in this experience, but 95% of the students have no curiosity nor a desire to learn. It’s disheartening for sure.

1cwq6qm,ChatGPT Brings Down Online Education Stocks. Chegg Loses 95%. Students Don’t Need It Anymore,"It’s over for Chegg. The company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (market cap $471.22M), made millions by solving school homework. Chegg worked by connecting what they would call ‘experts’, usually cheap outsourced teachers, who were being paid by parents of the kids (including college students) to write fancy essays or solve homework math problems.

Chegg literally advertises as “Get Homework Help” without a trace of embarrassment. As Chegg puts it, you can “take a pic of your homework question and get an expert explanation in a matter of hours”. “Controversial” is one way to describe it. Another more fitting phrase would be **“**mass-produced organized cheating**”.**

But it's not needed anymore. ChatGPT solves every assignment instantly and for free, making this busness model unsustainable.

Chegg suffered a 95% decline in stock price from its ATH in 2021, plummeting from $113 to $4 per share.

In January, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan downgraded Chegg, Inc**.** to Sell from Neutral, lowering the price target to $8 from $10. The slides are as brutal as -12% a day. The decline is so steep that it would be better represented on a logarithmic scale.

If you had invested $10,000 in Chegg in early 2021, your stocks would now be worth less than $500.

* **While some professors have encouraged the use of AI tools, that remains the exception.** Many schools continue to try and catch the use AI writing tools, hence the adoption of Turn-It-In, GPTZero, and other tools.
* **There are real life consequences to being accused of cheating:** failing a class, getting suspended, or even getting expelled are all possible outcomes depending on a school's honor code.
* **These detection tools are being treated like they're truth-tellers:** but they're actually incredibly unreliable and based on unproven science.

**What do experts think?**

* **A comprehensive report from University of Maryland researchers says no.** False positive rates are high, and various simple prompting approaches can all fool AI detectors. As LLMs improve, the researchers argue, true detection will only become harder.
* **A Stanford study showed that 7 popular detectors were all biased against non-English speakers.** Why does this matter? It shows how constrained linguistic expression is what flags AI detection, and simple prompts to add perplexity can defeat GPT detectors.

**In a nutshell: existing GPT content detection mechanisms are not effective.**

* **This is because they rely on two flawed properties to make their determination:** ""perplexity"" and ""burstiness."" But humans can easily flag these simple AI heuristics by writing in certain styles or using simpler language.

**Pressed by Ars Technica, GPTZero creator Edward Tian admitted he's pivoting GPTZero away from vanilla AI detection:**

* **What he said:** ""Compared to other detectors, like Turn-it-in, we're pivoting away from building detectors to catch students, and instead, the next version of GPTZero will not be detecting AI but highlighting what's most human, and helping teachers and students navigate together the level of AI involvement in education.""

**Final thoughts:** expect this battle to continue for years -- especially since there's loads of money in the AI detection / anti-cheating software space. Human ignorance re: AI will continue to drive cases of AI ""cheating.""

1cjvxlp,I’m considering dropping out of college.,"I’ve seen this topic mentioned before, but it seems when it comes up, the person asking is either finished with college or has yet to start. I’m already in it, but am feeling very uncertain about if I should finish.

I’m 30. I didn’t get my associate’s degree until I was 28, and I won’t have my bachelor’s degree until a few months before my 31st birthday. Honestly, if I’d foreseen AI becoming what it is, I wouldn’t have returned to college at all. But degrees aren’t really refundable, are they?

Anyway, I’ve had this on my mind for a while, but what finally pushed me to feel the need to post is I discovered the ChatGPT Coding subreddit. In short, seeing people with absolutely zero experience (by their own admission) churning out a ton of projects (games, dashboards, etc) with only AI tools makes me feel like I’d be better off dropping out of college and purchasing a plethora of AI tool subscriptions. That’s not to say I don’t enjoy college at all - I wouldn’t have chosen to go back if I didn’t - but what exactly is the point if someone my niece’s age can spit out a full-fledged game in a few days? Okay, that’s a bit of an exaggeration (my niece is 13; no one on that sub is that young, I don’t think), but I have seen some people say they don’t know what language their code is in, and just copied and pasted until they got the product they wanted. So, what am I studying for? Why don’t I have AI create a portfolio for me and start applying to jobs (someone actually suggested I do this)?

My initial goal was web development because that is sincerely what I enjoy most. But expenses don’t care what I enjoy most and it seems like it doesn’t make sense to stay in college unless I switch my focus wholly to AI/ML. Plus, why would anyone hire a human web developer anyway if you don’t even need to understand what the code does to get what you want (I saw at least one person say he’s glad he doesn’t need devs anymore)?

I realize no one can actually tell me what I should do, but this is genuinely keeping me awake (it’s almost 5am in my time zone; I really have been awake all night), so I would appreciate any opinions. To be transparent, I don’t have any experience in tech at all. My entire working background is customer service and warehouses. Thanks in advance.",92,179,2024-05-04 10:56:22,ArtificialInteligence,1.675977653631285,1.675977653631285,0.0,2.2346368715083798,7.262569832402235,3.35195530726257,0.5586592178770949,3.35195530726257,0.5586592178770949,0.5586592178770949,4.4692737430167595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5586592178770949,0.0,0.0,30.726256983240223,2.793296089385475,0.0,0.5586592178770949,0.5586592178770949,0.0
144bh1l,chatgpt just got sued!,"A man named Mark Walters, who is a radio host from Georgia, is suing OpenAI. He's upset because OpenAI's AI chatbot, called ChatGPT, told a reporter that he was stealing money from a group called The Second Amendment Foundation. This wasn't true at all.

Mark Walters isn't just mad, he's also taking OpenAI to court. This is probably the first time something like this has happened. It might be hard to prove in court that an AI chatbot can actually harm someone's reputation, but the lawsuit could still be important in terms of setting a precedent for future issues.

In the lawsuit, Walters' lawyer says that OpenAI's chatbot spread false information about Walters when a journalist asked it to summarize a legal case involving an attorney general and the Second Amendment Foundation. The AI chatbot wrongly said that Walters was part of the case and was an executive at the foundation, which he wasn't. In reality, Walters had nothing to do with the foundation or the case.

Even though the journalist didn't publish the false information, he did check with the lawyers involved in the case. The lawsuit argues that companies like OpenAI should be responsible for the mistakes their AI chatbots make, especially if they can potentially harm people.

The question now is whether or not the court will agree that made-up information from AI chatbots like ChatGPT can be considered libel (false statements that harm someone's reputation). A law professor believes it's possible because OpenAI admits that its AI can make mistakes, but doesn't market it as a joke or fiction.

The lawsuit could have important implications for the future use and development of AI, especially in how AI-created information is treated legally.

**what are the implications?**

This lawsuit could have several key implications:

1. **AI Liability and Regulation:** If the court holds OpenAI accountable for the false statements generated by ChatGPT, it could set a precedent that AI developers are legally liable for what their systems produce. This could lead to increased regulation in the AI field, forcing developers to be more cautious and thorough when creating and releasing their AI systems.
2. **Understanding of AI Limitations:** This case highlights the limitations of AI, especially in the context of information generation and analysis. It could lead to a greater public understanding that AI tools, while advanced, are not infallible and can produce inaccurate or even harmful information. This could, in turn, impact trust in AI systems and their adoption.
3. **Refinement of AI Systems:** Following this lawsuit, AI developers may feel a stronger urgency to improve the safeguards and accuracy of their AI systems to minimize the potential for generating false or damaging statements. This could drive innovation and advancements in AI technology, including the implementation of more robust fact-checking or data validation mechanisms.
4. **Ethical Considerations in AI:** The case also highlights the ethical responsibilities of AI developers and the organizations that use AI. If developers and companies can be held accountable for the output of their AI, it could result in more thoughtful and ethical practices in AI development and deployment.
5. **Legal Status of AI:** Finally, this case could contribute to ongoing discussions and debates about the legal status of AI. If an AI can be held responsible for libel, this could lead to a re-evaluation of AI's legal standing, potentially even resulting in AI being recognized as a distinct legal entity in certain circumstances.

15bcdgc,AI detectors DON'T WORK,"Teachers and college professors: If you use them, you risk falsely accusing an innocent student of cheating with AI. [Anecdotal evidence](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1683254059015499776) of this has grown over the months as students have been sharing their stories.

My view: One honest, eager student is a treasure worth caring for infinitely more than it is worth trying to prevent hundreds of indifferent ones from cheating with AI (or otherwise).

AI detector builders: If you can’t make your detector work 100% and you can’t a priori predict when it will fail, then you should not commercialize or promote it.

Researchers from the University of Maryland conducted [a rigorous study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156) on AI detectors in June and their conclusion is clear—and dismal:

“For a sufficiently advanced language model seeking to imitate human text, even the best-possible detector may only perform marginally better than a random classifier.”

Or put otherwise: teachers may as well just throw a coin in the air to decide whether a student cheated.

That’s BAD.

I understand teachers are worried and anxious about the incoming school year and detector builders want to help, but these tools are a no-solution. They are a non-strategy that must be avoided.

As a final reason why AI detectors shouldn’t be relied on:

The companies making ChatGPT-like models (OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, etc.) [are committed](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23802274/artificial-intelligence-meta-google-openai-white-house-security-safety) to implementing an internal watermark to AI-generated text.

They’re incentivized to do so that their next models aren’t trained on the excreta or older ones, causing ""[model collapse](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-ai-feedback-loop-researchers-warn-of-model-collapse-as-ai-trains-on-ai-generated-content/).""

But not even the most talent-dense, deep-pocketed, AI-savvy companies have been capable of solving this problem infallibly and reliably in the seven months since ChatGPT was released.

As Janelle Shane says, “[Don’t use AI detectors for anything important](https://fortune.com/2023/07/03/janelle-shane-ai-weirdness-dont-use-detectors-for-anything-important/).”

I gave ChatGPT with the browsing feature a try, and it did provide me with decent information, but it only searches a single source for its results.

17dokrv,I probably got AI-generated reviewer comments. Help?,"I recently submitted a manuscript and I finally got the reviewer's comments back. While two of the reviewers had some minor comments (all of them very plausible, even though sometimes harsh!), reviewer #3 gave comments I only can describe as weird and non-human, as all of them are written in a way I would strongly associate with ChatGPT. The comments are mostly very non-specific and don't fit into my field at all. I strongly assume that someone just used ChatGPT to write some comments and never proofread them. Unfortunately, the editor also does not seem to have checked the comments...

Do you think I should ask the editor again what they're thinking? In my experience, they do not really care about whining authors 🙃

Did something like this already happened to you?

E.g. they want me to explain our methods ""in great detail"" - but in the abstract section. They tell me to give explanations for some abbreviations, as they would be missing - but they're *clearly* there. In general, I get a lot of comments about missing context/information/references which are clearly written in the text. But they also want me to explain some methods which are very very basic, e.g. how to calculate a mean and standard deviation?!

EDIT: 
some FAQs
- No, I cannot prove that the comments are in fact from ChatGPT. If they aren't, they are rather odd and unhelpful
- I don't think it's just from a non-native speaker using ChatGPT for translation

zxtsxo,"What do you think the ""outcome"" of trying to prevent cheating via AI will look like?","I was just glancing at [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zxcp71/professor_catches_student_cheating_with_chatgpt_i/) and it's gotten me thinking about what happens when AI is well-developed enough to be virtually ""uncatchable."" Right now AI can make up legit-looking but not real sources so they're easy to check by just looking up the citations. Additionally, IME many AI-generated pieces are fairly stilted in their language use.

But some day that won't be the case. In fact, some day it may be possible that AI can essentially create an otherwise legitimate, well-done paper (as in, pull real sources together and create a novel document from them) with little student input.

How do you think higher ed will adapt? (I'm thinking mostly about teaching/testing students, but if you want to talk about research and scientific writing, feel free!) 

I feel like if we can somehow get away from this ""college is to get a job"" so that many/most students don't actually care about the learning but are just there to check a box we might be able to just generally reduce the impetus to cheat in general, but that will require some significant societal change.

I was thinking that in many fields that might ask you to write a paper (as opposed to sit an exam during class time where you couldn't access an AI bot) we may benefit from giving up the ""arms race"" and returning to a model of oral examinations. Each student meets with the instructor (small classes) or 1-2 TAs in a team of several (larger classes) and basically take an oral examination. Examinations can be recorded for review if there are complains/questions afterward. 

But then I thought about how many students these days have anxiety-related or similar concerns if not full out accommodations and how much that would probably increase if students knew they'd regularly have to do oral examinations. Additionally, it may be hard to have every student receive fair, equal-difficulty tests without giving them the same questions to answer, yet if you give them all the same questions it would be difficult to prevent early test takers from telling others what they will be asked.

zku9ed,What are the limits of ethics using AI to write a manuscript,"Short history: Can I use ChatGPT to rewrite one or a couple of paragraphs to resolve reviewers' comments? Am I cheating?  


I just discovered the ChatGPT3 from OpenAI and I'm in love. It has helped me a lot to overcome a creative block I was facing to finish a manuscript from my PhD where 2 of 3 coauthors (the 2 advisors) are quite absent, and for this reason, I stopped working on this manuscript for 1.5 years. Every time I tried to take it back I felt anxious and blocked. However, I'm currently passing a great moment of my life that brings me back to the joying of scientific writing, especially a couple of high-impact manuscript acceptance this last month.  Thus, using the ChatGPT I got the draft of two paragraphs that helped a lot to move fast with this manuscript. Because I'm deeply editing these two paragraphs I think there are no ethical concerns about it. However,  today I ask the ChatGPT to rewrite the paragraph of the objectives in another manuscript that received a minor review. The major concern is the lack of clarity in the objectives. Thus, I just asked to the ChatGPT rewrite this in a clearer manner and nail it. The paragraph is amazing now and I'm planning to use it directly as it is in the manuscript to send back to the journal. My question however is if I'm pushing the ethical line far from the gray area and if I can be punished in the future for this approach.   


Please note that I'm talking about a couple of paragraphs (300 words maximum).",49,50,2022-12-13 13:13:47,AskAcademia,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
13o0jst,To what extent is it an instructor’s job to deal with ChatGpt (as opposed to the administration’s job)?,"I’m curious to hear what you think. I work in humanities, and ChatGpt affects teaching in my discipline a lot. I understand that it is the instructor’s job to design effective assessments for the learning outcomes. 

However, I also feel that it is not fair for us if we are supposed to design assessing tools that are “ChatGpt-proof.” I saw people changing from written exams to oral exams, or using videos to assign papers, etc. There are assignments that intentionally include ChatGpt as part of it. It costs a lot of time for instructors, sometimes without even knowing if the new design works.

So far, I just have had students talk about ChatGpt and why it is a threat to education. I feel that’s all I can do. I just want to give them the benefits of doubt and grade their papers as if they are “real.” It will take too much time redesigning my assessments with lots of uncertainties. Is this reasonable?

Edit: From some replies, I feel that some have misunderstood my initial post. Here is what I think (modified from a reply I gave below):

ChatGPT is developing fast and it takes too much time to keep ourselves updated (as far as I know, its 4.0 version is much stronger and requires people to pay). We have limited time and there are so many other things to do, including all kinds of ways to make our pedagogy better. And there is equity issues (I heard that the newest version runs better on better smart phones and computers. then what about the poor adjuncts who have to use those old computers provided by schools? Also, do we need to pay the newest version so that we understand it better as a cheating tool? I'm sure some students paid).

I believe that we need to **know** about ChatGPT and adjust our teaching. But it is not instructors' job to devote time to **learn**. Rather, it is the administrators' job to keep themselves updated and simply report back to the instructors, just like other services they provide for us. It is their job to hire *experts* to figure out better ways to work with ChatGPT in teaching, and it is their job to make proposals to instructors. This is way more effective and efficient. Letting instructors (with various backgrounds) get themselves familiar with ChatGPT and figure out ways to work with it is putting administrators' responsibilities onto individual instructors. This is neither right nor efficient.",49,37,2023-05-21 19:15:33,AskAcademia,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.7027027027027026,2.7027027027027026,0.0,2.7027027027027026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.7027027027027026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.91891891891892,2.7027027027027026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

114a8lj,Do you find academics using ChatGPT? How?,"I generally advise students against using this app for academic work because I find its writing quite bullshit-y and its opinions populist instead of evidential. It also has a lot of confirmation bias which we don't want in research work.

Even so, I decided to try it out. I asked ChatGPT to find similar publications to my research work. It gave me a good study. I appreciated it and asked for more.

And it started sharing fake, made-up papers. When I asked for DOI's, it shared DOI's to different papers. ChatGPT had claimed that my research work had been reproduced in the past with similar studies ... that didn't even exist. Some of the fake papers it talked about were very close to my study.

Indirectly, this app was shooting down the novelty of my work without sharing any evidence for it. An editor asking it to read even the title of my study would get a very negative output and think that the study has no novelty or unique contribution to the scientific literature.

Given that it's relatively recent, I fear that this might result in biases created by fake information shared by the app. How do you see academics use the app?",14,18,2023-02-17 05:09:51,AskAcademia,5.555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.666666666666664,5.555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.555555555555555,0.0,0.0,50.0,5.555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
18gb29h,Handling ChatGPT issues in writing assignments,"I am curious how people in humanities (or other areas in which courses include lots of writing assignments) handle ChatGPT.

This is the situation I am facing. I am almost sure that some students used ChatGPT, but we know that there is no reliable and authoritative detectors. I heard that people usually just asked to meet with such students. But what do people do? Do you really try to just make students confess? I also know that some people asked them to orally reformulate their ideas in those assignments. But I am not sure how to handle it. If they cannot retell their arguments or main ideas, do you therefore take some points off? Or do you just conclude that the writing was generated by ChatGPT? 

I just feel pretty helpless here. I also know that I cannot *prove* that some students used ChatGPT. I tried very hard to avoid having my own biases toward those suspicious assignments. Anyway, it is just very hard for me.

As a side note, for one course I taught this semester, I only had in-class writing assignments. All writing assignments were done in class with handwriting. It is a pain in the ass to grade them, but the result was good.

18ac5jz,Explicitly using AI language models to facilitate learning (Seeking insights from academics),"Good day everyone!

I am interested in what your experiences in utilizing AI in facilitating learning. when referring to AI I mean language models like chatGPT, Claude etc.

Specifically, for those who have allowed and/or integrated AI langugae models in your teaching, I am interested in learning where have you applied it, what was your rationale, and what are your strategies. I assure everyone that I am not doing research for a manuscript but I am trying to learn from fellow acadmics (young and senior) on what have been your practices. 

For context, this is my experience:
I am m social science teacher hence my insights are mostly limited to pedagogies in sociology, political science and history. 

From personal experience and reflection as a university level lecturer, I see two distinct ways in utilizing AI: first is outright allowing it to be used to process readings, answer quizzes and write essays; and second is integrating AI in learning activities such as explicitly requiring students to utilize AI tools as part of the learning. I refer to the former as copilot style, and the latter as co-learner style. 

In assessing the two, I lean more towards the latter--. The former is simply too unpredictable if not checked or supervised, and it also leads to dilemmas of grading, attribution and assessment. I however see value in it in terms of assisting students in making sense of oftentimes, overwhelming information like ancient readings or thick rims of data (e.g. government documents). This is especially true when students are ESL or EFL students. Language models have been useful for them to make sense of complicated data that requires them to translate information in several layers (e.g. from academic english, to their langauge, to conversational english). 

In terms of the co-learning model, I explicitly require students to use AI language models i  their learning activities. I do so to either demonstrate a point on the value of critical thinking, ease the process of managing info, or even using as an opportunity to teach ethical ways of using AI. For example, I ask students to use chatgpt or bard to summarize and identity key points from classical sociology scholars like Weber. I give them a basic prompt to ask, and they are to ask to critique it in class. They can obviously use AI to critique it  but I find that language models tend to be bad in self-critque and reflection. They usually go around to the same point. I have other activities but I hope my point is clear here. 

I know that AI in teaching is a complicated topic, and the current consensus or at least the more popular take is to ban AI language models. I, however, prefer to approach it from a lens of opportunity to address existing challenges and anticipate potential challenges that may arise from it.

I am therefore in your experience with AI as a learning tool. Feel free to debate and disagree but I encourage you to indicate your reasons. My objective, again, is to seek insights.
